\chapter{Data Preparation And Characterization}
\section{Data Preparation}
Prior preparation of data using a spreadsheet software
\begin{enumerate}
\item Have removed the '*'s in all of the marks column. 
\item Absentees have been given 0 marks in the respective subjects replacing the 888 marker.
\item Correcting totalling errors for about 21 records.
\item Added 'class' fields for each of the marks by using the following discretization. All marks attributes were scaled to 100.
\begin{itemize}
\item $< 35$ : FAIL
\item $< 50$ : PASS
\item $< 60$ : 2nd class
\item $< 85$ : 1st class
\item $> 84$ : Distinction
\end{itemize}
\item 
\end{enumerate}


Note : The following columns have the said number of rows with NA data. 
Shouldn't really matter as they are not being used in any of the experiments
\begin{itemize}

\item DOB = 1
\item NRC{\_}MOTHER{\_}NAME = 42
\item NRC{\_}FATHER{\_}NAME = 32
\item L1{\_}RESULT = 2
\item L2{\_}RESULT = 32
\item L3{\_}RESULT = 38

\end{itemize}
